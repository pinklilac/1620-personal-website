            <p>
                I am <strong>Jane Shim</strong> 
                I was born and grew up in South Korea. I came to Canada after high school graduation 
                to receive a university education. I graduated from UBC with a degree in Bachelor of Science in Agriculture.
                I also went to the United States and studied Education. I received a master's degree from UVic. 
                I live in Burnaby. I always live in Burnaby when I am in Canada. 
                For my hobbies, I enjoy watching Kdrama and exercising. <em>I do not play video games.</em> 
                I may be the only one who does not play video games on this planet.
                I am pretty much a beginner in web development. I look forward to learning it throughout this course.
            </p>
